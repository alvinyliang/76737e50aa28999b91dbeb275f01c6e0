## When cloning the project:
  - Configure database credentials WebContent/WEB-INF/db_config.properties (use AWS database)
  - Add External Jar -> MySQL Connector/J 6.0.5 to project buid path
  - Create /lib directory under /WEB-INF and include the following files
    - mysql-connector-java-6.0.5 https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/mysql/mysql-connector-java/6.0.5
    - jstl-1.2 https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/javax.servlet/jstl/1.2
    - javax.json 1.0.4 https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.glassfish/javax.json/1.0.4
  - Under Eclipse "Problems" tab, change project JRE path to match current Java Version. Current JRE is set to version _111.
  - Set the database information in db_config.properties at WebContent/WEB-INF/db_config.properties

  	- Based on edit distance
  	- Include three functions: 
  		- ed : integer ed(string s1, string s1):
  			- returns the edit distance between s1 and s2. 
  			- The function assumes that the strings have the same case.
		- edth : boolean edth(string s1, string s1, integer th)
			- returns true if the edit distance between s1 and s2 is smaller or equal than th. 
			- The function assumes that the strings have the same case.
			- This function might be slightly faster than ed as it can stop as soon as the edit distance goes above the threshold.
 		- edrec : boolean edrec(string s, string rec, integer th)
 			- returns true if there is a token in rec that has an edit distance from s smaller or equal to th. 
 			- The string in rec is tokenized using the following separators: " " (white space), "," (comma), and "." (dot).
 			- The function assumes that the query string is in lower case.
 - Implemented connection pooling
 - Implemented MySQL replication
 - Implemented PerformanceLogger to log the execution time and other informations include:
 	- type: 'TS' (execution time of search servlet) or 'TJ' (execution time of JDBC) 
 	- config: test plan id
 	- auto_cmp, title: parameters required for search servlet 
 	- Fabflix/reports/log to access the log  
 - Fabflix/jmeter_report.html to access the jmeter report
 	- add query time=<h>[%3A<m>[%3A<s>]] to specify the earliest time of output log
 	- add query config=<test id> to specify the test id of output log
